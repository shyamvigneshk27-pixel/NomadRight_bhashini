"""
Shared helpers for the BHASHINI model adapters (asr.py, nmt.py, tts.py).

All three adapters talk to a single local model service, bhashini_models.service,
provisioned entirely offline via rootfs/roles/indic during image build (CTranslate2
ASR/NMT engines + Flite TTS, compiled and cached on-device). No adapter in this
package ever reaches out past localhost - this module is the one place that
constructs the base URL, so that guarantee is easy to audit.
